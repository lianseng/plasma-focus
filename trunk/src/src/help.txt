Quick start
===========
1.  Choose a pre-defined model from the drop down box
2.  Press "Fire Shot" to run a simulation, and view the results.
3.  Tune the model parameters by pressing "Tune" for fine tuning based on existing values.
    Or press "Re-Tune" to reset tuning and start from norminal values.

Adding a new model
==================
1.  The model files are saved in a configured directory (see System Configuration), typically "models".
2.  Type in a new name in the drop down box, tune the machine parameters and settings, and "Save Model"
3.  You can add a current trace file if you have one.  Create a trace file by saving from "Excel" using the
    "Save As..", and then select "csv file" as the file type.  The trace file generated is expected to 
    contain the time, current values in each row, with the values separated by a comma.  

Screen Explanation
==================
Configuration
1.  Select model from the standard directory (see System Configuration).
    Or "Load Model" from any directory.
2.  "Save Model" to save any changes you make
3.  "Fire shot" to run 1 run of simulation.  Change the parameters and repeat as you want.

Graphs
1.  Click on small graphs to see a bigger graph.
2.  All graphs support zoom and pan.
3.  Right click on graphs for more functions, like "Show points data"

System Configuration
1.  Tune the genetic algorithm parameters like mutation rate, cross-over rate, fitness weights, etc
2.  Select the current trace filtering mechanism you want

Tuning
1.  "Fine Tune" starts fine tuning from current model parameter values.  Do this if you are not satisfied with
    the last tuning fit.
2.  "Re-tune" resets the parameters and starts tuning from guesses
3.  "Tune Electricals" if you want to tune L0 and R0 besides the model parameters.  
    Input nominal values of L0,R0 first.
4.  "Fire shot" is the same as the one in Configuration
5.  "Reload" the model parameters from file if you want to reset your work.
    Or "Save Model" saves your work.
6.  The green line on the graph shows the current detected "pinch" position.
    Use "Pick Point" to change the point to one you think is better, and tune again
7.  "Stop tuning" stops the tuning after the current generation is completed.
8.  The R2 value of the fit is displayed.  
9.  The current trace file used for tuning is also displayed.
