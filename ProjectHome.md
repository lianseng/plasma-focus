The use of Lee Model (http://www.intimal.edu.my/school/fas/UFLF/) requires a manual tuning step to tune the model parameters by fitting the model output with measured output (actually the current trace).

Unless you are an experienced user, the tuning process is tedious.  This code reimplemented the VBA code and automates the tuning.

This program was developed using the [Microsoft C# Visual Studio Express](http://www.microsoft.com/exPress/download) and the excellent [zedgraph](http://zedgraph.org) graphics library.

If you need help, email me.   I will try my best.

I have graduated and I am looking for somebody who is interested in taking over this project.  Please email me if you are interested in being a contributor.
